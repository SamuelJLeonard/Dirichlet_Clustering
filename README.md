## Dirichlet Clustering

Here you'll find code for my graduate research: a Dirichlet process mixture model designed to detect spatial disease clusters.

This repository is a work in progress.  For now the only code I have up is a simple algorithm to generate a matrix in which entry (i, j) is log(Stirling number of the first kind(i, j))

Why the heck would a disease clustering model need a table containing Stirling numbers?

It turns out that these Stirling numbers are a coefficient in the distribution of the number of components generated by a Chinese restaurant process with fixed alpha.

[This PDF by T. Stepleton](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tss/antoniak.pdf) describes why this is the case.
